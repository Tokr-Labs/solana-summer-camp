Our Solana Summer Camp submission is a suite of open source tools we created to accelerate the Solana community's ability to build simple experiences around crypto, and enable real consumer utility within a native mobile application. We demo this toolset in our own use-caseâ€“â€“the Rhove appâ€“â€“and showcase how we currently use this suite of tools.

We have created several open-source solutions to enable the Solana community to build upon these foundational primitives and broadly accelerate mainstream adoption.

1. Non-custodial wallet for every user enables DeFi degens, NFT communities, and normies alike to receive NFTs, invest with crypto, and earn airdrops, all without ever needing to know or be aware of the how behind the experience.
2. Mobile first, Swift iOS, crypto native experience. We must meet customers where theyâ€™re at to scale crypto consumer products beyond the early days of narrow web3 adoption.&#x20;
3. Make NFTs useful again. Empower users to build their reputation with on-chain attestations, earn rewards for their actions, and access exclusive token gated experiences. Freehold is a suite of open-source tools used to facilitate this. We must move beyond the milieu of 10k PFPs, and it will take real use-cases to pull the industry's energy in this direction.

Taken together, we have created a suite of primitives that the Solana community can now use, extend, build upon, and improve to accelerate the adoption of the next million users on-ramping to Solana.&#x20;

These are the initial pieces and parts that, taken together, will enable on-chain identity to bridge between IRL and crypto-native experiences. It will allow traditional and web3 brands to deeply connect with their consumers through intuitive user experiences underpinned by NFT ownership and exclusivity. It will enable consumers to be AFK, on their mobile devices, transacting across the Solana ecosystem. Lastly, it enables any type of person to use Solana for uniquely crypto-enabled experiences **safely**.
