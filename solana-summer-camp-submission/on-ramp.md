# üè¶ On-Ramp

The Rhove app is now one of the most user-friendly on-ramps to the world of Solana, powered by an integration with [Web3Auth](https://web3auth.io/). Simply by creating an account with Rhove, every user is given a non-custodial Solana wallet. Core experiences we will enable with this functionality include:&#x20;

* Mint NFT badges
* Receive airdrops for actions taken in the app
* Access exclusive token-gated investing experiences
* (Insert succinct explanation of solflare pfp)
* Fund their Rhove account with crypto (coming soon)

## How does it work? <a href="#3773" id="3773"></a>

Integrating with [Web3Auth](https://web3auth.io/), we seamlessly create unique and secure wallets on the Solana blockchain using familiar web 2.0 authentication design patterns during the Rhove sign-up process. Access to your wallet will always be available through your Rhove login credentials, and you will always have the ability to import this Solana account into your favorite Solana Wallet, like [Phantom](https://phantom.app/), [Solflare](https://solflare.com/), etc.

## Why Web3Auth? <a href="#e219" id="e219"></a>

We believe everyone should hold the keys to their crypto wallets but recognize there are challenges that non-technical users may encounter when storing seed phrases and private keys. That‚Äôs why, specifically so that users have the benefits of self-custody without any of the burdens.

Web3Auth is a leader in self-custody wallets and is:

* Enabled by multi-party computation (MPC) threshold cryptography
* Open-source
* Routinely audited

## Firsts <a href="#45bb" id="45bb"></a>

We worked directly with the Web3Auth team to make wallet creation for the[ Solana blockchain possible](https://github.com/torusresearch/torus-utils-swift/pull/25). We‚Äôre strong believers in open-source and contributing to projects that help the ecosystem. Our team takes pride in helping tackle difficult problems and publishing code that can help others accelerate.

## What‚Äôs Next? <a href="#cee5" id="cee5"></a>

We can‚Äôt wait to onboard a million people to Solana in the next year, not only enabling them to invest in real-world assets but to do so with non-custodial solutions.
