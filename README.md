## Background

Tokr Labs is on a mission to expand access and opportunity for everyone to invest in and own the places they live, work and play. We are building an open finance for real estate protocol to bring greater access and autonomy to the world.

We were[ recently announced as one of the winners of Solana's Riptide hackathon](https://twitter.com/solana/status/1514364456867962885) placing 4th in the DAO track for Tokr’s novel application of blockchain technology to mint a real estate legally backed NFT that can be financed using DeFi protocols, a first of its kind implementation.

At inception, we chose to tackle our use-case first and then build an open protocol around it. It is critical first to solve the business and compliance challenges that are barriers to entry in this market. Then, after solving those problems, we are integrating our protocol and exploring creative web3 experiences that don’t yet exist in the market.

This Summer we launched [Rhove](https://rhove.com), our beachhead product after [receiving SEC qualification in May](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001883678/999999999422000179/xslQUALIFX01/primary\_doc.xml). We have solved all compliance challenges in granting retail investors access to invest in individual commercial real estate assets.

The Rhove app is now the only mobile wallet that enables anyone to invest in private real estate for as little as $1 per share and with no lock-ups. It is the only Coinbase for real estate experience that exists in the market with no minimum investment requirements, no lock-up periods, and access to attractive deal flow. The product includes a unique social experience, underpinned by web3 native functionality.
